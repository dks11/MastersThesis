( this has been the stated processfor the bottom two categories , and we are adding satisfactory to this processas well . )please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team ,yourself , or an hr professional in reviews being conducted by inexperiencedmembers of your management team , or those management team members where youhave a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid andperhaps tough performance feedback . i believe that we have spent some timein identifying these situations . i ask your help to ensure that we followthrough on this commitment .thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid - year prc process ameaningful one .it is dave delainey ' s intent to announce it if 0###

"and . . . one by one , the people in the stands bowed their heads , held handswith one another , and began to pray . they prayed in the stands . they prayedin the team huddles . they prayed at the concession stand . and they prayedin the announcer ' s box . the only place they didn ' t pray was in the supremecourt of the united states of america - the seat of " justice " in the onenation under god .somehow , kingston , tennessee , remembered what so many have forgotten . . . weare given the freedom of religion , not the freedom from religion .praise god that his remnant remains !let ' s celebrate jesus in 2001jesus said , " if you are ashamed of me , i will be ashamed of you before myfather .

696.txt|12/30/1899 12:00:00 AM|||||||as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million .many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision .i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry .thank you .###
