1119.txt|12/30/1899 12:00:00 AM|||||||california ' s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . we want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis . please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on california energy issues .what happened in californiathe source of california ' s current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand . california ' s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . so demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result , predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis . first , the state ' s regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . in california , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was fine while the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remained in effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .in short , california ' s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation . regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented new generation from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices .at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warned the state ' s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which , if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .enron ' s rolemany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by the politicians and the media . here are the facts :? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in the state of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in the same market available to other california purchasers . because we are a market maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers .? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection from the problems the states ' utilities , and their customers , now face . we protected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power on the open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a " turnback " of our customers to the utilities . here are the facts :? as a result of a variety of factors existing in the current california market , it made more sense for ees to source power for its customers directly from the utilities . this decision reduced ees ' s market price risk by allowing ees to access lower utility rates .? ees did not terminate any customer contracts , and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices .? ees is continuing to work with its california customers to provide them with other energy - related products and services , including assistance in reducing the demand for power , particularly at peak times .enron is currently proposing solutions to help california work out of its crisis ; enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in western power markets . enron ' s primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been more demand for our products and services .the solutionthe solution to california ' s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , the state must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state ' s utilities .increasing supplycalifornia ' s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simply must streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities .reducing demandcustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand . they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retail market would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .reducing reliance on the spot marketin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market . opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk .restoring the financial integrity of the state ' s institutionsthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led to greater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed .just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that , while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make matters worse . price caps have been proposed . they don ' t work ; have never worked ; and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages , which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valley or silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse .the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in california . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in , constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result in california tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roads and other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media , it ' s important for you to know this : we at enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state .###

" we expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to the partnership ' s distributable cash flow , and excellent prospects exist for further organic growth of the east texas system . ' 'enbridge partners will acquire 1 , 880 miles of various diameter gathering lines , 37 compressor stations , four gas treating plants with a capacity of 595 mmcf / d and three gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 375 mmcf / d . the transaction is anticipated to close in december .the intrastate system derives revenues from the purchase , transportation and resale of natural gas . additionally , when natural gas liquids fractionation spreads are positive , the option exists to extract ngls from purchased gas , thus leveraging income with incremental processing revenue , the company noted . the partnership expects that the direct commodity price exposures inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing will be suitably mitigated through a hedging strategy .it forecasts gas supply available to the system will be 400 - 420 mmcf / d in 2002 . based on this estimate , the acquisition would contribute incremental ebitda of between $ 26 million and $ 32 million for the year , while distributable cash flow would increase by between $ 0 . 10 and $ 0 . 15 per unit , with further improvements anticipated in 2003 . the forecasts assume that acquisition financing will consist of 50 % debt and 50 % equity , in line with enbridge partners target long - term capital structure .enbridge partners also reported third quarter net income of $ 6 . 6 million , or $ 0 . 13 per common unit , compared with net income of $ 14 . 2 million , or $ 0 . 42 per unit , for the third quarter in 2000 . the decline was attributed mainly to an adjustment to oil inventory due to shippers of $ 5 . 4 million . the adjustment was the result of what enbridge said were refinements in the oil loss estimation process , as well as improvements in the accuracy of measuring oil losses while developing new software applications .third quarter deliveries were 1 , 208 million b / d compared to 1 , 272 mmb / d for the same period in the prior year . the partnership expects that deliveries will increase over the remainder of the year , to average between 1 . 30 and 1 . 33 mmb / d . however , its delivery estimates for 2001 and 2002 are down from prior expectations because of lower production forecasts for conventional heavy crude oil , which stem from the current wide price differential between heavy and light crude . for 2002 , growing oil sands production is anticipated to boost full - year average deliveries to between 1 . 35 and 1 . 43 mmb / d ." the partnership ' s forecast indicates that crude oil delivery volumes , which have languished for the past several quarters , will start to improve modestly in the near term with more significant increases occurring in the latter half of 2002 , " said tutcher . " the major contributing factor will be increased production from the immense oil sands reserves in western canada . we also anticipate further successes from our acquisition strategy , which will increase earnings and diversify our sources of income . the partnership ' s primary objective over the next two to three years is to accelerate the growth of cash distributions to unitholders . to that end , we are confident that the acquisition of the east texas facilities combined with some improvement in liquid hydrocarbon deliveries will position the partnership to consider a distribution increase in 2002 .

1228.txt|12/30/1899 12:00:00 AM|||||||introductionin response to feedback received from enron traders worldwide , we haveupgraded and improved the stack manager to include new functionality which wehope will improve its effectiveness and usefulness in the management of yourproducts .this new release will be automatically installed within the next few days .please ensure you log out at night in order to receive the upgrade .summary of new featuresmultiple children - a " child " product can be the " parent " of another child( multiple links in a chain ) and different types of links can be placedagainst a single parent .static product bar prices - when you change a price in the product bar andhit the " + " or " - " button , the price stays - it does not reset to the amountin product properties until you logout .sorting - you can sort by any field on the products tab simply by clicking onthe title of the field . for multiple sorts , hold down your " shift " key .parent products which are at the top of a stack do not have their basisrelationship identified . ( e . g . the product bar might before have said : " basislink - parent " and now would say " stand alone , parent " ) .detailed feature descriptionsmultiple childrenthe new version of enrononline allows you to link several products togetherin a long chain . for example , child product a can be linked to parent productb , which is in turn linked to parent product c .warning : although there is no absolute limit to the number of links in achain , system performance is degraded by large chains . this is because when acustomer attempts a transaction , the database must " lock " each and everyproduct in the chain before it can process the transaction request . thedatabase must then update the stack for each product before releasing thelocks . " vertical " chains ( multiple parents and children in one long link ) aremuch slower to process than " flat " chains ( one parent with many children ) .large vertical chains should be avoided .related to this feature is the ability to have several types of links on thesame parent . for example , child product a can have a basis link to parentproduct b . at the same time , child product c can have a syncopated basis linkto the same parent product b . parent b is the parent for both a syncopatedbasis link and a regular basis link .static product bar pricesthe new version of enrononline provides for " sticky " product bar price andvolume changes . when you change a number on the product bar , it does notreset to the number contained in the product properties menu until after youhave logged out . this makes it easier to update prices , volumes , spreads oroffsets in a changing market without repeated hits to the " + " or " - " buttons .one of the benefits of setting these numbers to appropriate levels is that itreduces repeated price movements . with the old version of stack manager , ifthe price delta was too small , traders would often repeatedly hit the pricemovement buttons . each of these price changes must be communicated across thewebsite to customers and consumes valuable bandwidth . this makes it harderfor customers to transact with us - each time they try , a new price updatemoves the price , resulting in an increased transaction failure rate . enteringan appropriate price into the price delta field and then pressing the pricemovement button means that fewer ( but larger ) price movements are necessary ,improving overall system response and reducing customer transaction failurerate .you may also notice a new addition to the product bar prices - a new fieldfor offset to last trade . this allows you to update the offset for productswhich have offset to last trade selected from the product properties menu .sorting / selectingthe new version of enrononline provide significant additional sortingfunctionality over the old . you can now choose any field heading ( type ,location , reference period , etc . ) and sort by that item . you can do multiplesorts by holding down the shift key . example : if you select type and thenlocation while holding the shift key , you will see your products sorted firstby product type and then within each product type , by location ( inalphabetical order ) .if you right click on the product menu , you can choose from the same sortcriteria , plus you can select " sort by web order " , which allows you to seeyour products in the same order as they would appear to a customer on thewebsite ( note however , that a customer on the website might be also seeing anumber of products in addition to the ones you are managing ) .when you select products , you can drag your mouse while holding down the leftmouse button as always , but now you can also hold down the key whilemaking your selections . this allows you to highlight products which are notnecessarily adjacent to one another .parent products and f / x productsone of the differences in the way that the new version works is in itstreatment of how parent products are displayed . the old version showed thetype of link associated with the parent in the product bar ( to the left ofthe main product bar update buttons above the products tabs ) . the new versiondoes not show the type of link . this is because the new version allows formore than one type of link on each parent product .some traders may notice that their products which have f / x links are nowidentified with a stylised " fx " in the product list . this is to enable easyidentification of products which are run as a foreign exchange link to theparent , rather than managed individually .assistanceas always , if you have any problems with any enrononline functionality ,please contact the 24 hour help desk ( houston : 713 853 4357 , london : + 44 ( 0 )20 7783 7783 , australia : + 61 2 9229 2300 ) .general feedbackif you have any comments on the new functionality , or suggestions for furtherfunctionality , please call david forster on 713 853 1861 . if you hadpreviously suggested new functionality which didn ' t make it into thisrelease , rest assured that you have not been forgotten - we are working hardto improve all elements of enrononline and will try to incorporate yourrequests into the next release of the enrononline stack manager .###

1253.txt|12/30/1899 12:00:00 AM|||||||california  , s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last severalmonths . unfortunately , this debate has generated more heat than light . wewant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis .please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situationand our position on california energy issues .what happened in californiathe source of california  , s current problem is as straightforward as supplyand demand . california  , s economy grew 29 percent since 1998 . this increasedthe demand for electricity by 24 percent . at the same time , regulatoryrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state . sodemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added . the result ,predictably , is a shortage . this summer , peak capacity will be about 10percent shy of peak demand , leading to further blackouts in the state .in addition to the supply and demand imbalance , there are two other relatedfactors that led to the current crisis . first , the state  , s regulationsforced all sales and purchases into the spot market . the spot market forpower is extraordinarily volatile . the way firms behave in a free marketwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases longterm , medium term and short term , to reduce exposure to this volatility . incalifornia , state regulation prevented this strategy . this would be theequivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in themost volatile interest rate environment imaginable . everything was finewhile the power surplus persisted , but when shortages ensued , every megawattwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price .second , retail markets were not deregulated . regulated retail rates remainedin effect , and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keepcompetition out . this meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesaleprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at theregulated retail rate . they are now nearly bankrupt .in short , california  , s problems were caused by regulation , not deregulation .regulations prevented competitors from entering the market , prevented newgeneration from being built , and prevented prudent hedging against volatilespot prices .at the time california was developing its restructuring plan , enron warnedthe state  , s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives , which ,if adopted , would have averted the current crisis .enron  , s rolemany political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fixthe problem . power sellers , including enron , have been vilified by thepoliticians and the media . here are the facts :? other than a small amount of wind power , enron is not a generator in thestate of california . every megawatt we sold in california we bought in thesame market available to other california purchasers . because we are amarket maker , not a generator , we are not biased toward high prices . we areinterested only in having a market that works so that we can package productsfor our customers .? as a seller to end - use markets in the state , we provided protection fromthe problems the states  , utilities , and their customers , now face . weprotected , and still protect , our customers from price volatility .you may have read that ees recently elected to have the utilities supplypower directly to its customers in california instead of procuring power onthe open market . early reports mischaracterized this as a  enron continues to sign up customers in the state ; and enroncontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in westernpower markets . enron  , s primary business is managing risk for our customerswith solutions customized to meet their needs . there has never been moredemand for our products and services .the solutionthe solution to california  , s crisis is also straightforward . in summary , thestate must increase supply , reduce demand , reduce reliance on the spot marketand shore up the financial stability of the state  , s utilities .increasing supplycalifornia  , s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothingshort of byzantine . enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in lessthan a year . in california , it often takes 5 to 7 years . california simplymust streamline this process . ironically , while many of the regulationsgenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality , theregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online anddisplacing current plants , which emit 40 times as much nox . california canhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of newfacilities .reducing demandcustomers in california today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand .they pay the same rate no matter what the market price is . an open retailmarket would trigger demand responses , which would balance supply and demandat lower prices than today . california should fully open its retail market .reducing reliance on the spot marketin a truly deregulated market , customers would protect themselves fromvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longerterm , fixed - price basis . the state has instead left procurement in the handsof the utilities , which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market .opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over theirprice risk .restoring the financial integrity of the state  , s institutionsthe utilities in california are not paying their bills . this has led togreater uncertainty in the market , higher costs , and reduced flexibility toarrive at lasting solutions . california must permit its utilities to recovertheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission anddistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it isneeded .just as important as doing these things , the state must avoid policies that ,while politically attractive , do not fix the problem or even make mattersworse . price caps have been proposed . they don  , t work ; have never worked ;and they will not work here . price caps succeed only in creating shortages ,which then have to be allocated among competing users . imagine howineffectively the government would be in determining , for example , whether itis better to make its limited power supplies available to the imperial valleyor silicon valley . price caps are a surefire way to make the currentshortage worse .the state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission incalifornia . there is no reason to believe , and every reason to doubt , thatthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in ,constructing , operating and maintaining assets . this will also result incalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and powergeneration - - which the private sector can do - - instead of education , roadsand other public goods - - which the private sector cannot do .as you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about thecrisis from the media , it  , s important for you to know this : we at enron willcontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose realsolutions to the state .###

1464.txt|12/30/1899 12:00:00 AM|||||||fred or anita ,i just wanted to recap our discussion to be sure that we are all on the samepage . from my understanding , the allocation for meter 785 : state tract 121is supplied from bryancy braumley . prior to 09 / 1 / 00 bryancy would calculateflow from certain wellheads , total this volume , and then send us anallocation that would show how much gas was allocated to texas general landand hpl ( sale from cleco ) at meter 785 . effective 09 / 1 / 00 a compressor wasput in and the gas from 785 now flows through this compressor , as well as thegas from meter 9662 ( deal 137595 sales from dewbre ) , and is now measured atmeter 3527 : tivoli station . for bryancy ' s allocation , she must take the meterstatement from meter 3527 and deduct meter 9662 ' s flow . once this is done ,she can take that net number and do an allocation between texas general landand hpl ( cleco ) like she has done previously . i believe meter 785 is now acheck meter and meter 3527 is the actual pay meter .for 9 / 00 there were two deals in place for the sale from cleco , deal 397957and 449243 . per discussions with daren farmer , danny conner , and jennifermartinez , i have been instructed to zero out the deal for 397957 and use449243 as the correct deal number . therefore , fred boas and i have zeroedout the 397957 deal and placed the volume that was allocated there to deal449243 . deal 397957 was priced at ship less . 18 which was incorrect and deal449243 is priced at ship less . 15 . therefore , an adjustment will generatefor 9 / 00 for the difference in price and the change in location . theallocated volume for cleco did not change . however , i am not sure thatbryancy is allocating the volume properly between texas general land and hpl( cleco ) . i have spoke to her , as well as jennifer martinez , and curtisfunderbruk with cleco so there might be some pma ' s for volume differences .in addition , i have changed the allocation method at meter 3527 to be acallout \\ swing effect 9 / 00 . for october and succeeding months , the volumeshould be computed by taking meter 3527 deducting out meter 9662 . thenbyancy should take this net number and split it between texas general landand hpl ( cleco ) . the texas general land nom is currently at meter 785 andthe hpl ( cleco ) deal is at meter 3527 . fred mentioned that the texas generalland nom might need to be moved to meter 3527 but nothing has been decided onthat yet .please let me know if something i have stated is not your understanding oryou need something more done on my end . also , let me know who is going to bedoing this monthly allocation . it might be beneficial to have one persondoing all the points ( meters 3527 , 9662 , 785 ) . thanks for your help ! ! !###

1866.txt|12/30/1899 12:00:00 AM|||||||yesterday , enron settled a procedural dispute with dynegy over northern natural gas . our settlement allows dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline , dismisses their texas lawsuit and extends enron ' s right to repurchase until june 30 . we reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring enron out of bankruptcy . while we would like to keep northern natural , we still have some 9 , 000 miles of safe , profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses .the settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $ 10 billion damage claim against dynegy . it also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts .we want to see a positive future for the employees working with northern natural gas . below is a copy of a message from stan horton further explaining this decision to the employees of enron transportation services .kendear ets colleague :on thursday , enron entered into a settlement over dynegy ' s exercise of its option to acquire the northern natural gas pipeline . the settlement allows dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while enron pursues its damage claim against dynegy .in this respect , enron corp . has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of northern natural gas . consequently , enron corp . has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of northern natural gas to dynegy , while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved .the company has concluded that with this settlement , enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly , as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court . for the northern natural gas employees , i believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day - to - day satisfaction of running a valuable , successful business .beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe , reliable and efficient operation of northern natural gas .over many years we have run high quality , cost conscious and profitable businesses in ets . keep up the good work !stan###

statushere is a quick status and list of to do ' s related to setting up the new j . v .between enron & texaco which will be combining the lrc and bridgelinepipeline systems :summary : the lrc & bridgeline pipeline systems will be combined under thename of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be tradingon the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are inthe process of being drafted .enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems tosupport this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understandthat accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhapsscheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 stfloor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allencenter once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jvwill start in early february for march production .to do ' s :accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture ittransition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting nextmonday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the samepage and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at myrequest . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that thevoice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spotis nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . acombination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have beenrequested .location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson fromfacilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wallcubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wallcubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal andmeter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begintrading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dumpof this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also needto know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up thesystem security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t knowwho else will need access .interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scadaapplication : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wrightfrom texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the twoapplications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' srtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantimethere will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everythingis merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces betweenpop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition iscomplete .scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back toenron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back tothem via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costsby switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is bestdone as a part of the scada transition .accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to bebetter defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get thisprocess started .hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may bebilled on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talkthrough this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at leastinitially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support thebilling for this one customer .please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can havemy assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reachedat 713 - 853 - 6858 . thanks ! - tommy###

1983.txt|12/30/1899 12:00:00 AM|||||||affiliatesngi ' s daily gas price indexbreaking news : posted sep 26 , 4 : 16 pmproposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliatesfederal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate .previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates .the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to .commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . " i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . " she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . " i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . "wood said he understood " the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . " staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . " if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , " one staffer responded .wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , " but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

( all intrastate pipelines that perform section 311 service must either have their rates approved by ferc or they must charge rates that are approved by a state regulatory body for a similar service . ) pg & e ' s filing proposed , in addition to the usual interruptible service , a firm section 311 service as well as an interruptible parking and lending service . pg & e also filed a revised statement of operating conditions to reflect the new services .2 ) on february 25 , 2000 , southern union gas company , an intrastate transportation customer of pg & e , filed a late motion to intervene and raised issues which it stated should be addressed in a hearing . pg & e opposed the late intervention , but ferc granted it on april 14 , 2000 . ( pg & e stated that southern union was intervening in order to gain leverage in renegotiating its contract for intrastate service . )3 ) southern union submitted data requests to pg & e on april 13 and april 17 . pg & e attempted to get a protective order issued , but ferc rejected their request .4 ) a settlement conference was held on september 7 , 2000 .5 ) a staff panel was convened on october 2 , 2000 , in order to conduct an advisory , non - evidentiary proceeding for oral arguments on the issues , with instructions to make recommendations to the commission within 90 days .6 ) on november 1 , 2000 , ferc requested 5 pages of additional information from pg & e in order to complete the application in the proceeding , which pg & e provided on november 8 th . on december 8 th , pg & e provided additional information in response to a ferc data request .7 ) on january 10 , 2001 , southern union submitted a proposed alternative to the cost of service and rate design that was filed by pg & e .8 ) on january 17 , el paso field services informed ferc that pg & e texas pipeline , lp had been acquired by el paso on december 22 , 2000 , and that the name was changed to epgt texas pipeline , lp .9 ) on january 24 , 2001 , epgt texas and southern union filed initial briefs .10 ) on july 17 , 2001 , epgt filed supplemental comments in response to the discussion at ferc summarized below , where commissioner wood inquired about the extension of some order no . 636 and 637 provisions to section 311 service providers . epgt stated that , if ferc proceeds with this policy , it should do so in a generic rulemaking and not in an individual pipeline proceeding . on july 30 , 2001 , southern union filed reply comments opposing epgt ' s supplemental comments .11 ) on august 3 , epgt filed an amended statement of operating conditions , which provides for electronic nominations , two additional nomination cycles , bumping , clarified and updated credit provisions , modified quality provisions to protect system integrity , and more clearly defined authorized overrun service .the ngpa gives ferc authority over intrastate pipeline rates for section 311 service and requires that such service be provided on a non - discriminatory basis , but there is some question as to whether it gives ferc authority to require , for example , compliance with order nos . 636 and 637 .please let me know if this is enough detail ( or maybe it ' s more than you wanted ! ! ) .###

it runs through this processing on the application and generally doesn ' t find a match . i know patti has mentioned this several times and i can ' t think of a valid reason for performing this work . i talked with dave nommensen , and according to him , what used to happen is that sometimes schedulers would get duplicate paths out there which is why they put this code in place ? ? ? from a scheduling perspective , my understanding of what your main concern is to just maintain your position and be able to change it . if you were overpathed , you ' d see it in the path manager either way . [ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system " autonoms " so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .###

2575.txt|12/30/1899 12:00:00 AM|||||||to all employees :this morning enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses :- - we filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the u . s . bankruptcy code . contrary to popular belief , this does not mean we are out of business . what it does mean is that we have entered into a court - supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses , reorganize our finances , and explore various strategic , operational and financial alternatives , including the sale of non - core assets , in an orderly manner .- - in connection with our filing for chapter 11 reorganization , enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor - in - possession ( dip ) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly . upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements , the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement enron ' s existing capital and help the company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business , including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today ' s filing .- - we filed a lawsuit against dynegy , alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for dynegy ' s wrongful termination of our proposed merger . we are asking the court for damages of not less than $ 10 billion .- - we also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company ' s wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure . as contemplated , this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from enron ' s current wholesale energy trading team , and will conduct counterparty transactions through enrononline .these are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business . from an operational standpoint , our energy businesses - including our pipelines , utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world , and will continue to do so .as you know , the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost - savings program . this will entail a significant reduction in our work force . this is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day tuesday , though in some cases notification will take longer .for our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process , you will remain on the company payroll for now . in addition , we will submit a severance pay plan to the bankruptcy court for approval . this approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits . we will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the court has made its determination .i know these actions raise new questions about our company ' s future and what this means for each of us . your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on monday to discuss these events with you . in addition , you can access a copy of the press release on . we will also have a q & a and other materials for you on monday . while there is a great deal we simply don ' t know yet , we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions .when decisions are made affecting our company , people , and operations , we will let you know as quickly as possible . there is still considerable value and opportunity in our business . the strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities .on behalf of the board and entire management team , we greatly appreciate your patience , your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future .ken###

( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it ' s easy tosee . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keepthis mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignmentgauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before youclamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the " wiggling " thatoften occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it ' s great tohear that so many people are enjoying the tips .talk to you again in a few weeks .jon garbisonon - line editorwoodsmithvisit our other woodworking and home improvement sites :100 + woodworking plans :woodsmith magazine :shopnotes magazine :workbench magazine :kits , jigs , tools , project plans :back issues :woodworking forums :to change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again atto unsubscribe , send empty email message to :note : your subscribed email address is###

this feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a " top of stack entry " it will create back to back transactions ; one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .in order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed top of stack " option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the " allowed " option should be selected .please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out .restricted top of stack limit orders - this feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader ' s stack price . stack manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the floated stack window . orders will be queued by price and time stamp . when a counterparty trades on a " top of stack entry " it will create back to back transactions one between enron and the counterparty submitting the order , and the other between enron and the counterparty clicking on the website .in order to turn on this functionality select the " allowed as restricted top of stack " option , in the orders section of the product properties page . if regular limit order functionality is desired the " allowed " option should be selected . if a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the " restricted top of stack " feature .advanced filtering ability on all products tab -

( just an fyi - ? ) do we need to getthis assigned ? i can find oldnotes and try to get this pathed if necessary . someone just needs to letme know .lavaca expense transport - this is offsystem gas that hplc transports forena . ena has no nom at meter 1000 in pops for jan 1 .midcon texas pipeline - there were deals left unpathed for jan 1 ( anddec ? ) . i brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10 , 000 withtransport contract to move this gas on and no sale to broker to . as itstands , it looks like we have a long position . who is this assigned to ? ithought carlos was handling this one , but i could be wrong .channel industries pipeline - several issues here :1 . all deals with the exception of the long term transport expense were leftunpathed for jan 1 . i viewed prior month transactions and pathedappropriately . someoneneeds to review for accuracy . also , there were deals that went to zero ,that were nominated for january .2 . we still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement . thisissue has been left unsresolved since october 99 . volume management cannotallocate was isnot pathed and nominated .3 . there is a transaction for january that is once again not on our pointspecific transport contracts . ( rec mtr 1 - 6366 10 , 000 to del mtr 2 - 620310 , 000 ) . this is a pathed pipeline . we have no rate . we need to know therate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for thistransaction , we are not legally covered . carlos was handling this pipe indec . who is this assigned to for jan ?hpl operational - this shipper on hpl has been left unpathed for decemberand january 1 . who is this assigned to ? this can wait until we get backnext week . if it is left unresolved , i will get it pathed when i return .pat - the following was my recollection of the assignments for dec 1 tothe present . you might want to confirm with mary smith and then you canproceed with decisions that need to be made based on possible unassignedissues .hank eisenhours duties were split :mandey - handle all long term hplc expense issues : undeveloped contracts ,december flow forward and cleanup of 1999 unresolved issues .carlos - all offsystem transactions for ena and hplc in unify and alloffsystem paper and electronic noms on intrastate pipes . ami and staceyalso handle some . there is a lot of confusion here . i found unpathed gasfor december . we ' ll need to address this one quickly .hpl transports were all split by zone . each logistics rep is responsible forpathing all meters in their assigned zones in unify .hpl operational seems to be left unassigned .i think most of the desk assumed that carlos took over hanksresponsibilities . the assignments above are my recollection only .###

[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this .2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system " autonoms " so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ?3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools .4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process .5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard .###

871.txt|12/30/1899 12:00:00 AM|||||||ngi ' s daily gas price indexpublished : october 17 , 2001ferc issues nopr on intra - day recalls of released capacitygiven the inability of the natural gas standards - setting organization to resolve the issue of intra - day recalls of released transportation capacity , ferc has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking ( nopr ) that would give releasing shippers the flexibility to re - nominate their recalled capacity at the next scheduling opportunity provided by an interstate pipeline .existing gas industry standards board ( gisb ) standards require a shipper that wants to re - nominate recalled capacity to notify its transportation provider by no later than 8 a . m . central clock time ( cct ) on a nomination day at the latest , and bars partial - day recalls of capacity . ferc proposes to allow shippers to recall capacity and re - nominate the recalled capacity at each of the three intra - day nomination opportunities ." by enabling releasing shippers to recall and renominate capacity quickly , they will have greater incentive to release capacity , providing capacity purchasers with an alternative to purchasing pipeline interruptible service . at the same time , this proposal will provide replacement shippers whose capacity is recalled with the same advance notice and protection from bumping as is provided to interruptible shippers under the commission ' s regulations , " the nopr said [ rm 96 - 1 - 019 ] .existing gisb standards applying to capacity - release recalls were adopted in 1996 , when there was only one nomination per day at 11 : 30 a . m cct and a single non - standardized intra - day nomination , it noted . " but the circumstances under which the recall standards were developed have markedly changed as the number of nomination opportunities have now expanded to four nomination opportunities . "given the lack of " consensus supporting " gisb ' s existing recall standards and the standards - setting group ' s failure to settle the issue , the commission is forced to " resolve the policy question regarding partial - day recalls , " the nopr said . permitting partial - day recalls of released capacity , the commission concluded , was in keeping with the overall regulatory changes that it enacted in order 637 .the natural gas supply association ( ngsa ) , which represents major producers , and houston - based dynegy let ferc know that they weren ' t big fans of partial - day recalls . these could undermine system reliability , they contend , by shutting in production and increasing scheduling problems , overruns , penalties or operational flow orders .but the commission discounted these arguments . " . . . [ t ] he use of partial - day recalls should create no additional scheduling problems since recalls will be scheduled according to the existing scheduling requirements . in effect , releasing shippers using partial - day recalls are creating another form of interruptible transportation to compete with pipeline interruptible capacity , and shippers purchasing recallable capacity should be subject to the same scheduling rules that apply to interruptible transportation . partial - day recalls will be no more likely to result in shut - in production than interruptible transactions that are subject to being bumped under the current standards , " the nopr noted .###
