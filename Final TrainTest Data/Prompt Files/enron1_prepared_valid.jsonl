{"prompt":"Subject: neon retreat\nho ho ho , we ' re around to that most wonderful time of the year - - - neon leaders retreat time !\ni know that this time of year is extremely hectic , and that it ' s tough to think about anything past the holidays , but life does go on past the week of december 25 through january 1 , and that ' s what i ' d like you to think about for a minute .\non the calender that i handed out at the beginning of the fall semester , the retreat was scheduled for the weekend of january 5 - 6 . but because of a youth ministers conference that brad and dustin are connected with that week , we ' re going to change the date to the following weekend , january 12 - 13 . now comes the part you need to think about .\ni think we all agree that it ' s important for us to get together and have some time to recharge our batteries before we get to far into the spring semester , but it can be a lot of trouble and difficult for us to get away without kids , etc . so , brad came up with a potential alternative for how we can get together on that weekend , and then you can let me know which you prefer .\nthe first option would be to have a retreat similar to what we ' ve done the past several years . this year we could go to the heartland country inn ( www . . com ) outside of brenham . it ' s a nice place , where we ' d have a 13 - bedroom and a 5 - bedroom house side by side . it ' s in the country , real relaxing , but also close to brenham and only about one hour and 15 minutes from here . we can golf , shop in the antique and craft stores in brenham , eat dinner together at the ranch , and spend time with each other . we ' d meet on saturday , and then return on sunday morning , just like what we ' ve done in the past .\nthe second option would be to stay here in houston , have dinner together at a nice restaurant , and then have dessert and a time for visiting and recharging at one of our homes on that saturday evening . this might be easier , but the trade off would be that we wouldn ' t have as much time together . i ' ll let you decide .\nemail me back with what would be your preference , and of course if you ' re available on that weekend . the democratic process will prevail - - majority vote will rule ! let me hear from you as soon as possible , preferably by the end of the weekend . and if the vote doesn ' t go your way , no complaining allowed ( like i tend to do ! )\nhave a great weekend , great golf , great fishing , great shopping , or whatever makes you happy !\nbobby\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 0"}

p\nas many of you may agree , some , not all , of these stocks move in\nprice because they are promoted , making a very large number of\ninvestors aware of the stock . the awareness is underway on dmxp ! pp\nlet ' s look at the company , delta mining and exploration corp .\notc : dmxpp\nabout the company : p\ndelta mining and exploration corp . otc : dmxp is a mineral exploration\ncompany that controls 6 properties totaling 7 , 554 acres\n( approximately 11 sq . miles ) in montana . the properties are all\nlocated over what management considers to be some of the most\nprospective diamond exploration terrain in the united states .\nanother 10 , 000 acres of prospective diamond and gold properties are\ncontrolled in bolivia , south america . initial work has revealed\nthat the bolivian properties display similar potential to those\nfound in north america . p\nthe management team is led by chief executive officer , dr . barry\nrayment , who is experienced enough to take this junior exploration\ncompany to the next level . dr . rayment brings 32 years of\nexperience in the field of geology , along with running some of the\nmost successful mining companies in the industry . dr . rayment was\nthe president of bema gold corp . , ( amex : bgo ) , a company with a\nmarket cap of close to a billion dollars . he was also affiliated\nwith glamis gold , gold fields mining and amselco exploration ( bp\nminerals ) , among others . his vast experience in the mining sector\nalong with his extensive knowledge of public companies will be an\nextraordinary asset to delta and its shareholders as the company\nmoves forward . p\namong the support team is stephen kay , a geologist with more than 30\nyears experience in exploration throughout europe , south africa ,\nsouth america and the united states . while with gold fields mining\ncorp . , stephen kay was instrumental in the discovery and subsequent\ndrilling of the 3 million ounce mesquite gold deposit in california . p\ndelta has experienced significant technical success since its\nstart - up in 1997 . for example , delta has discovered the first\nin - situ microdiamond ever found in montana on its homestead\nkimberlite , southeast of lewistown . the company also controls part\nof the three buttes kimberlite where initial exploration has shown\nthe three buttes kimberlite to host typical diamond indicator\nminerals - a major step toward finding the presence of economic\ndiamonds - including pyrope ( garnet ) , chromite and clinoprroxene . p\nan aggressive regional exploration program has the potential to\ndiscover additional kimberlite or lamproite pipes in this\nunder - explored area to the south of known commercial diamond bearing\nkimberlites in saskatchewan and alberta , canada . p\nin bolivia , delta controls approximately two - thirds of a highly\nprospective diamondiferous terrain referred to as the independencia\ngroup of concessions covering 7 , 860 acres ( 12 sq miles ) . the other\none - third is presently being explored by de beers . in addition to\nthe independencia property delta controls more than 2 , 000 acres\ncomprising the highly attractive precambrian property that displays\nall the diamond indicator minerals that would suggest further\nexploration is justified . p\ndelta seeks to increase growth for its investors not only by testing\nits extensive portfolio of diamond exploration properties but also\nby acquiring additional diamond properties . delta will focus on\nidentifying and developing strategic alliances with major mining\ncompanies as well as joint ventures to develop the properties and\nfinance additional exploration . p\nin addition to the highly prospective diamond properties delta\ncontrols , they also control a gold property with great potential .\nthe property is near la paz in bolivia , where initial analysis\nrevealed high levels of gold per ton that would more than justify an\nextensive exploration program . pp\n( source : company website ) p\nrecent headlines : go online and read the full stories ! p\ndelta mining and exploration corp . is invited to attend a\nconference with the bolivian chamber of commerce . p\ndelta mining and exploration corp . visits homestead property in\npreparation of work program . p\ndelta mining and exploration corp . discloses preliminary gold\nexploration findings in south america . p\ndelta mining and exploration , corp . looks to continue diamond\nexploration in south america . pp\nwill dmxp explode higher as more and more investors become aware of\nthe stock this weekend and next week ?

one quarter section spacing ( 160\nacres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the\nprovince allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units\n( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s\nsatisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased\nwell density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has\nbeen down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering\npekisko oil we will down space as well .\ngeological discussion\npekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and\nassociated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the\nsylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the\npekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was\ninfluenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying\nthis ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the\nmississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous \/ jurassic impermeable\nshales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and\naccount for billions of barrels of reserves .\nproduction facilities discussion\nthis immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas\nover the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering\nand processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been\nconstructed .\na major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our\nproject with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed\ndrilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is\napproximately 70 mmcf \/ d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf \/ d . accordingly ,\nexcess capacity of 24 mmcf \/ d exists in the facility which would be in\nthe best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible .\nthis gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the\ntransportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of\nred deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get\noil product to the transportation system .\nfor more detailed project description please see news release dated\n( fri , apr 29 ) .\ngood luck and successfu | trading .\nconclusion :\nthe examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known\ncompanies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ;
